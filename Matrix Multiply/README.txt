Build: Ctrl + b
Run: Run by modes (commented out main method and called individual functions to get the first 5 functions working.

q6: This is run with the arguments 4 3 2 as the dimensions for the matrices. This mode will print the resulting matrices a,b, and c = a*b in the console.
q7: This is run with the arguments 300 250 200 50/100/150 as the dimensions for the matrices and the fourth (last) input being number of repitions. The three different options for number of reps is to show that the average time should stay around the same despite the number of reptitions.
q8: This is run with the arguments 4 240 4 20 as the smallest dimension, bigget dimension, step size, and the number of repitions at each step.
